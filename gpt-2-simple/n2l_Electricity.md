### DEFINITIONS FOR "TITLE" ARE AS FOLLOWS

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

- **M[ZXC]OMENTUM** is defined as **MOMENTUM**
- **M[ZXC]ASS** is defined as **MASS**
- **M[ZXC]OTION** is defined as **MOTION**
- **V[ZXC]ELOCITY** is defined as **VELOCITY**
- **A[ZXC]CCELERATION** is defined as **ACCELERATION**
- **F[ZXC]ORCE** is defined as **FORCE**
- **B[ZXC]ODY** is defined as **BODY**
- **P[ZXC]OWER** is defined as **POWER**
- **C[ZXC]ONTEXT** is defined as **CONTEXT**
- **S[ZXC]KOPE** is defined as **SKOPE**

**───────────────────────────────────────────────** 
 
1) **FORCE** produces **MOTION** in a conductor that has **MASS** by creating **ACCELERATION**. 
2) If a **MASS** has no **ACCELERATION**, then there are no **FORCE**.
3) A **MASS** can exist without **FORCE**, but there can be no **MOMENTUM** or **ACCELERATION** without **FORCE**.
4) **FORCE** is the cause, **ACCELERATION** is the immediate and disequilibriated effect.
5) **FORCE** and **ACCELERATION** combined produce **POWER** in the direction of **VELOCITY**.
6) Changes to **MASS** (due to **FORCE**) in **VELOCITY** (relative to the ground) is the lasting equilibriated effect.
