# Pattern 236



The nomenclature used to identoiry types of concepts, words and definitions, is as follows:

- **[CONCEPT]** refers to the tholonic definition (below).
- **|concept|** refers to one of the three fundamental tholonic attributes.
- **ALL-CAPS** (bold) are concepts that are derived by integration.
- **lowercase** (bold) are concepts derived by dis-integration.

Because if this, standard writing style, such as capitalized starts of sentences, does not apply. 

This writing is a WIP, and is far from finished or free from error.  I welcome any constructive input, corrections, and feedback.

## Basic Tholonic Claim


The tholonic claim is that everything that exists, from objects to ideas, follows some sort of pattern that has evolved to be the most stable and sustainable pattern for a given context and scope. The most obvious examples can be seen in how nature works. Many patterns can vary in complexity, interdependence, dimensions, etc., but by definition, a pattern can always be mathematically described.

Using the simplest mathematical formulas, we start with the most basic: 1×1=1. This equation represents the unity of all existence and, while not very enlightening in describing patterns of duality, it does symbolize the unity of all things that exist, material or otherwise. The first duality to arise in the world of math is even vs. odd, making 2 and 3 the first balanced pair of values. Adopting the idea from Ancient Greek mathematicians that 1 is not just a 'number' but the 'womb' of all numbers, we can also say that 2 and 3 are the first two actual numbers.

For these reasons, the simplest pattern representing both parts of the duality is written mathematically as $\mathbf{2}\times \mathbf{3}=\mathbf{6}$. If the above tholonic claim is true, then we should recognize this pattern in nearly everything – and we do!

While there are many examples, the most famous and fundamental instance of this simple formula is Isaac Newton's 2nd Law of Motion, written only 11 generations ago in 1673. This law is reduced to $\textbf{F=ma}$, or $\textbf{mass × acceleration = Force}$. So, let's start with this.

Before we get into the main points of Newton’s 2nd Law, there are three concepts of **[instance]**, **[context]**, and **[scope]** that are worth reviewing as they will be used extensively in our example.

## Basic Tholonic Concepts

### [instance]

- An **[instance]** is a “coherent structure” that has the ability to transfer energy in order to exist.  

- **|limitation|**. An [instance] has definition and boundaries.  Examples include a rock, a city, a musical style, a religion, a mathematical formula, a theory, or a concept. In general, anything that can be described is an **[instance]**.
- **|integration|**. An **[instance]** Interacts with its environment in some way. This requirement also applies to everything that exists, including things that can only be imagined, such as concepts. The sustainability of an **[instance]** depends on it’s ability to integrate with its environment or **[context]**. 
- Example: The concept of AI (artificial intelligence) is an **[instance]** that transfers energy in its ability to process information in a way that emulates human reasoning and problem-solving, while an **[instance]** of a cell phone transfers energy via its ability to transmit and receive electromagnetic signals over various frequencies.  Both of these **[instances]** integrate very will with their **[context]** of “modern society”. **[instances]** adapt to their changing **[context]** or **[deinstantiate]**.  The telegraph in an example of an **[instance]** that has adapted to remain integrated to it **[context]**.  The paper phone book is an example of an **[instance]** that could not remain integrated and has **[deinstantiated]**, with various elements of its **[instance]** incorporated into other existing and integrated **[instances]** such as online directories, social media platforms, and mobile apps.
- **|negotiation|**. Every **[instance]** is the product of other instances that combine in some way, creating a type of parent/child hierarchy, or more accurately, a holon/parton relationship in what is referred to as a *holarchy*. This means that every instance has a "chain of custody", so to speak, an ancestral lineage that traces back to its origins, at least in theory. It must also have the ability to spawn new **[instances]**. Therefore, the formation of an **[instance]** can only emerge from a process of competition and/or cooperation between the instances from which it is created. These processes, be they peaceful, violent, creative, or destructive, are all forms of **|balancing|**. When the **|balancing|** is over, the remaining state is a **|balanced|**. These terms are synonymous with **|negotiating|** (as a verb) and **|negotiated|** (as a noun).
- **WORK**. The ability to transfer energy, as in the ability to "work." As this one criterion is a prerequisite for anything that exists on any plane or dimension of reality, it would include everything that has, does, or will exist. Given that everything, including ideas, transfers energy, the focus is on the mechanics of that energy transfer and how it works.

### [context]

- **[context]** refers to a “coherent domain” that describes the environment or setting in which a particular phenomenon, idea, or thing exists. It can be thought of as the bigger picture or context that surrounds and influences the specific **[instance]** it contains. A **[context]** can exist in a hierarchical or holarchical structure, with each **[context]** having parents and possibly having children. The **[context]** includes elements such as temperature, air pressure, and other environmental measurements, as well as elements such as public opinion, theoretical frameworks, ideological pressures, intention, and other non-material elements.  It is also possible for a **[context]** to have its own **[context]**, creating a hierarchy of **[context]** and **[instances]**. For example, the **[context]** of "string theory" has a parent **[context]** of "11-dimensional spacetime", which exists with the **[context]** of "higher-dimensional spaces". A **[context]** can also be a concept or idea that exists within a certain framework, and the specific details and elements of that concept are the **[context]** that exist within the **[context]**. The **[context]** provides the settings in which the specific **[instance]** operates and is understood.
- **[context]** can also refer to quantitative coherent objectivity, which is the environment that allows an **[instance]** to maintain its **[scope]** despite changes and challenges. This concept is often used when discussing concepts such as consciousness and spirituality.
- In short, **[context]** is a term used to describe an **[instances]** coherence and how it maintains its identity in a given environment.

### [scope]

- **[scope]** is a property of measure that defines the limits or properties of a **[context]** and **[instance]**. An example might be the force of gravity, which is different at sea level vs. a mountain top. An object falls faster at sea level than it does on a mountaintop. The **[context]** (surface of planet earth) and **[instance]** (a golf ball) are the same, but the **[scope]** of limits are different (air pressure, gravitational force, temperature, etc.)  **[context]** is like a map of a territory, and **[scope]** is like the reality of the territory.  
- Another way to think about **[context]** vs. **[scope]** is via the "Coastline paradox". If you measure the coastline of England with a 100 km ruler, the coast is 2,800 km long, but if you measure it with a 10-meter ruler, the coast is 10,000 km long. Here, the "coastline of England" is the **[instance]**, and the ruler's size is the **[scope]**, and “earth->geography->cartography->coastlines” would one possible **[context]**. 
- **[scope]** is always represented in units of measure, similar to how matter is the **[context]**, and **mass** is the measure of matter.



These concept can be used to describe the classical physics terms as well.  For example, here are the classical definitions of the common terms used in the examples that follow, and (below) their tholonic equivalent definitions

*Note: Where equations exist that require the value of time, unless otherwise stated, time is always assumed to be 1. The same goes for theta, the angle of interaction (between a force and a body), which is always considered to be 0 degrees. For example, where P=power, F=force, s=distance, the equation to calculate 'work÷time' is shown as P=(F×s×cos(θ))÷time, but this can also be written as P=F×v because if cos(0)=1, and time=1, the formula simplifies to P=(F×(s/time)×1)/1, and since (s/time) = velocity, we can simply write P=F×v. It important to keep in mind that these very simple looking formulas get very complicated as soon as variables like time, theta, acceleration, etc., start changing.  These formulas represent the simplest case, the archetype, of the concept.*

**mass** is a measure of a material **[instance]** and a property of **body**.

- *The **[scope]** of an **[instance]** in the context of matter.*

A **body** is a collection of matter within a defined contiguous boundary in 3D space.  

- *A material **[instance]** (with implied **[scope]** of **mass** and **[context]** of 3D space).*

**motion** is the change of spatial properties of a body with respect to time. 

- A change in the relationship of a **[contextual] [instance]** to its **[context]**.
  - **Explanation:** By replacing the concept of **body** with the concept of **[contextual]** **[instance]**, we've expanded the concept of **motion** beyond **mass**. For example, one of the **[contextual]** properties of an **[instance]** might be temperature. As temperature changes, we could say that temperature has **motion** because it has “moved” or changed. While this is outside the standard use of the word **motion**, it is conceptually 100% accurate. It's quite common to say, "The temperature has changed", which is identical to saying, "The temperature has **motion**"; it just sounds odd.
  - *NOTE: **motion** is essentially an ON/OFF state, as there is no consideration of how much **motion** occurs over how much time, so an **[instance]'s** **motion** only has the states of "in **motion**" and "not in **motion**."*

**momentum** is a (scaler) measure of the amount of **motion** of a **body**.

- *The **[scope]** of **motion** of an **[instance]***.

**velocity** is a (vector) measure of **momentum** in a certain direction in any point in time.

- *The **[scope]** of speed and direction at any point in time.*

**acceleration** is the rate of change of **velocity**.

- *"A change in the **[scope]** of **motion***
  - *NOTE: The word **acceleration** also implies **deceleration** if the change is negative. The correct word to use here is **celeration**, which means "a measure of change over time." However, this word is not typically used in physics but is common in psychology research, so we'll stick with acceleration, knowing it can also means **deceleration** under certain conditions. **motion** includes **acceleration**, **velocity**, and **momentum***.

**<u>FORCE</u>** is the interaction between two bodies that results in an exchange of energy, typically pushing or pulling.

- *The transference of energy between **[instances]**.*

**<u>POWER</u>** is the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred per unit time.

- *The amount of energy consumed by or transferred via **[instances]** over time*.

With all this in mind, let’s apply this pattern to Newton’s 2nd Law



●1●◀▶●◀▶●◀▶●◀▶●◀▶●◀▶●◀▶●◀▶●◀▶●◀▶●◀▶●◀▶●◀▶●◀▶●◀▶●◀▶●◀▶●◀▶●◀▶●

First we will look as the law itself.

## Newton’s 2nd Law of Motion ([context]: Mechanics)

The primary primary formula for Newton’s 2nd Law of Motion is 

**<u>FORCE</u>** = **mass** × **acceleration** ($F = m \times a$)

Because **<u>FORCE</u>** is a product of multiplication there are also two first-order or derivate formulas of:

**mass** = **<u>FORCE</u>** ÷ **acceleration** ($m=\frac{F}{a}$)
**acceleration** = **<u>FORCE</u>** ÷ **mass**  ($a=\frac{F}{m}$)

There are second-order derivative as well, such as. $m×F=impulse$ and $a×F=torque$, but for brevity and simplicity, we will only be considering the primary function and it immediate derivatives.

**<u>FORCE</u>** is the only value that is divided, making **<u>FORCE</u>** a holon, and  **mass** and **acceleration** are the partons.

We can think of **mass**, which is a scaler value (meaning a value that has no orientation or direction), as being 1-dimensional as is can be represented as a single value.  

**acceleration** is a vector value, meaning is has both magnitude and direction, so it is a 2 dimensional value.

**<u>FORCE</u>** is a 3 dimensional value as it combines both mass and acceleration.

Just like our 3 dimensional world exist in the 4th dimension of time, so too do the 3 dimension of **<u>FORCE</u>** exist  in time. This is expressed in the formula $F×time=POWER$.

From these three simple equations, we can determine the **<u>POWER</u>** of the interaction ($P=Fa$)

**<u>POWER</u>** this is best understood using the example of a light bulb.  A 100 **<u>WATT</u>** light means that is consumes 100 **<u>WATT</u>**s every hour.  A 10 **<u>WATT</u>** bulb consumes the same amount of electrical **<u>FORCE</u>**, but over 10 hours.

From these four formulas we can deduce an addition eight formulas as well.  Here are all 12 formulas:	

```
FORCE		mass		POWER		acceleration
-------- 	--------	--------	--------
F=√(P×m)	m=F÷a		P=a²÷m		a=F÷m
F=P÷a		m=F²÷P	 	P=F²×m		a=P÷F
F=a×m		m=P÷a²		P=F×a		a=√(P÷m)

```
Using Newton's 2nd Law, we can now state the following:

- **<u>FORCE</u>** produces **motion** in **mass** by creating **acceleration**. 
- If a **mass** has no **acceleration**, then there is no **<u>FORCE</u>** involved.
- **mass** can exist without **<u>FORCE</u>**, but there can be no **momentum** or **acceleration** without **<u>FORCE</u>**.
- **<u>FORCE</u>** is the cause, **acceleration** is the immediate and disequilibriated effect.
  - *‘disequilibriated’ refers to a “balancing”  (verb) exchange of energy, such as when sodium and hydrochloric acid are mixed, causing tremendous release of heat.  “Balancing” is always a transition to “balanced”.*

- **<u>FORCE</u>** and **acceleration** combined produce **<u>POWER</u>** over time in the direction of **velocity**.
- Changes (due to **<u>FORCE</u>**) in **velocity** (relative to the observer) is the lasting equilibriated effect.
  - *‘equilibriated’ refer to “balanced” (noun), stable state that results form the interactions.  In the case of sodium and hydrochloric acid, that “balanced” state is sodium chloride (table salt), which is extremely stable.*


If the above is true, we can then state:
- If the **<u>POWER</u>** remains the same:
  - As **<u>FORCE</u>** increases, **acceleration** and **velocity** decrease. 
  - As **acceleration** increases, **mass** decreases.

- To increase **<u>POWER</u>**, increase any of **acceleration** , **mass**, **<u>FORCE</u>**, and/or reduce time of the energy transfer.
- To increase **<u>FORCE</u>**, increase **acceleration** and/or increase **mass**.

Her are three different **[context]S** of the 236 pattern where we replace the concepts of **<u>FORCE</u>**, **mass**, and **acceleration** with the simple values of **<u>6</u>**, 2 and 3 (these values are not arbitrary, and the reasoning that determined them is detailed in the book “***THOLONIA, The Mechanics of Existential Awareness***”, so we won’t get into the lengthy explanation here).

## Numbers ([context]: Mathematics)

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

- **<u>FORCE</u>** is defined as **<u>6</u>**
- **mass** is defined as 2
- **motion** is defined as 3
	- *3 represents any form of **motion**, which includes **acceleration** (**3~a~**) and **velocity** (**3~v~**).  These concepts are not part of the **[context]** of numbers*.
- **velocity** is defined as **3~v~**
- **acceleration** is defined as **3~a~**
- **<u>POWER</u>** is defined as **<u>18</u>**
- **momentum** is defined as 2
  - *As **momentum** is a measure of **motion**, and **motion** = 3. Here **momentum** indicates the measure or quantity of the number 3 that are present.  For example, the quantity of 3 that exist in **<u>6</u>** is 2, so **momentum** = 2.  This is the same value as **mass**, which makes sense considering the “speed” of numbers never changes, so if **momentum**=**mass** × **velocity**, and **velocity** = **1**, then **2×1 = 2**.  Having a **velocity** of **1** also suggests that  have a **velocity** that is always 1 and never changes (whatever that means).*
- **body** is defined as **2×3=6**
  - *Typically, **body** represents the concept of a physical thing, like a rock.  Here, **body** also represents a concept, but in this case, the concept is the formula **2×3=6**.  Think of **body** as an **[instance]** that has **[scope]** within a **[context]**.*

**───────────────────────────────────────────────** 

Given the above, we can state the following:

- **<u>6</u>** produces the concept of 3 in relation to 2 resulting an instance of **3~a~**. 
  - If $\textbf{2x=6}$, then the $\textbf{x}$ is a concept of 3, and the value of 3 is the **[instance]** of that concept.

- If 2 is not multiplied by **3~a~**, then there is no **<u>6</u>**.
- 2 can exist without **<u>6</u>** or 3 but there can be no concept of 3 or the value of **3~a~** without **<u>6</u>**.

- **<u>6</u>** is the cause, **3~a~** is the immediate and disequilibriated effect.
   - 3 is the “balancing” (verb) value, and 2 is the “balanced” (noun) value.

- Changes (due to **<u>6</u>**) in **3~v~** (relative to 2) is the lasting equilibriating effect.
   - “*relative to 2*” means 3 and 6 will change ensuring that 2 remains unchanged, or $\mathbf{3}=\frac{\mathbf{6}}{\mathbf{2}}$, or $\textbf{a}=\frac{\mathbf{F}}{\mathbf{m}}$ . 

- - **<u>6</u>** and **3~a~** combined produce **<u>18</u>** in the direction of of **3~v~**.
   - *The concept of “direction” doesn’t really fit, AFAIK, in the **[context]** of a single number, but it is interesting to note that 3 gets priority over 2 in the formula **2×3×3=18**, perhaps because 3 is dominant.*

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

### The relationships in **2×3=6** are as follows:
- $6=2×3_a$
- $2=\frac{6}{3_a}$
- $3_a=\frac{6}{2}$
- $28=6× 3_a$

### Other relationships include:
- $28=2×3^2$

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

### If the above is true, we can then state:

- **<u>18</u>** can be increased by increasing 2, 3, or **<u>6</u>**.
- To increase **<u>6</u>** without increasing 2, increase **3~a~**.

### Some Observations:

- * **<u>6</u>** and **<u>18</u>** are the only values that are arrived at by multiplication. All other values are the products of division.
- 2 is what transforms the unity of **1** into a duality (that’s why it is called a duality, from Latin “duo”, meaning "2") making 2 the archetype of division and separation. In the context of math, this unified singularity is **<u>6</u>**.
-  In the equation **6=3×2**, we are actually saying **6=3+3**, but we can just as easily say **6=1.012345 + 4.987655**.  **6=3+3** is the most balanced equation, and therefore the equations with the highest entropy, or most stable state.

Another example is electricity

## Electricity ([context]:Physics )

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

- **momentum** is defined as **amperage**
- **mass** is defined as **RESISTANCE**
- **motion** is defined as **current**
- **velocity** is defined as **current~v~**
- **acceleration** is defined as **current~a~**
- **<u>FORCE</u>** is defined as **VOLTS**
- **body** is defined as **electrical circuit**
- **<u>POWER</u>** is defined as **<u>WATTS</u>**
- **[context]** is defined as **electromagnetism**
- **[scope]** is defined as **SI Units**

**───────────────────────────────────────────────** 

1) **VOLTS** produces **current** in a conductor that has **RESISTANCE** by creating **current~a~**. 
2) If a **RESISTANCE** has no **current~a~**, then there are no **VOLTS**.
3) **RESISTANCE** can exist without **VOLTS**, but there can be no **amperage** or **current~a~** without **VOLTS**.
4) **VOLTS** is the cause, **current~a~** is the immediate and disequilibriated effect.
5) **VOLTS** and **current~a~** combined produce **<u>WATTS</u>** in the direction of **current~v~**.
6) Changes to **RESISTANCE** (due to **VOLTS**) in **current~v~** (relative **RESISTANCE**) is the lasting equilibriated effect.

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

### The basic relationships in **CIRCUIT** (Ohm’s Law) are as follows:
- $\mathbf{VOLTS=resistance×current_a}$ 
- $\mathbf{resistance}=\frac{\mathbf{VOLTS}}{\mathbf{current_a}}$ 
- $\mathbf{current_a}=\frac{\mathbf{VOLTS}}{\mathbf{resistance}}$ 
- $\mathbf{WATTS=VOLTS×current_a}$ 
### Other relationships include:

- $\mathbf{WATTS=resistance×current^2}$ 

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

### If the above is true, we can then state:

- **<u>WATTS</u>** can be increased by decreasing **RESISTANCE** and increasing **VOLTS**.
- To increase **VOLTS** without increasing **RESISTANCE**, increase **amperage~a~**.

All these statements are true.

**Some Observations:** It’s important to consider the **[context]** of these examples.  Ohm’s Law only works in the **[context]** of our classical, linear reality.  In the **[context]** of extremes, such as extreme power, frequency, size, temperature, etc., Ohm’s Law in inaccurate.  However, given that most, if not all life exists in the **[context]** where Ohm’s Law does work, it’s safe to say that, in the **[context]** of life, Ohm’s law is fundamental. 

### Some observations:

- **VOLTS** is also called the “potential” as it represent the difference, or imbalance between two energy levels.  **VOLTS** also represent the unified singularity in the context of electricity.  This then tells us that the singularity defines the entire spectrum of possibilities, the limits of potential, as the sum of its divide parts can never be greater that the whole. 
-  $\textbf{6=2×3}$ is $\mathbf{6=3_j+3_k}$ and represents the balanced equation.  The difference or “potential” between the two $\textbf{3}$s is $\mathbf{3_j-3_k=0}$.  This is the same as saying **VOLTS** is the different between its divided parts, and the **current** is the **|balancing|** movement that integrates, and eventually **|balances|**, that difference until they are both equal.

## Tholonic v.2 ([context]: Thologram)

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

- **momentum** is defined as amount of **|integration|**
- **mass** is defined as **|limitation|**
- **motion** is defined as **|integration|**
- **velocity** is defined as **|integration|~v~**
- **acceleration** is defined as **|integration|~a~**
- **<u>FORCE</u>** is defined as **|balance|**
- **body** is defined as **THOLON**
- **<u>POWER</u>** is defined as **GENERATE**
- **[context]** is defined as **THOLOGRAM**
- **[scope]** is defined as **THOLONICS (TBD)**

**───────────────────────────────────────────────** 

1. **|balance|** produces **|integration|** in the process of creating **|limitation|** by creating **|integration|~a~**. 
2. If a **|limitation|** has no **|integration|~a~**, then there is no **|balance|** involved.
3. **|limitation|** can exist without **|balance|**, but there can be no amount of  **|integration|** or **|integration|~a~** without **|balance|**.
4. **|balance|** is the cause, **|integration|~a~** is the immediate and disequilibriated effect.
5. **|balance|** and **|integration|~a~** combined produces the ability to **GENERATE** over time in the direction of the **|integration|~v~**.
6. Changes in **|limitation|** (due to **|balance|**) and resulting changes in **|integration|~v~** (relative to the parent) is the lasting equilibriated effect.

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

### The basic relationships in **THOLON** are as follows:

- $\mathbf{|balance|=limitation×integration_a}$ 
- $\mathbf{limitation}=\frac{\mathbf{|balance|}}{\mathbf{integration_a}}$ 
- $\mathbf{integration_a}=\frac{\mathbf{|balance|}}{\mathbf{limitation}}$ 
- $\mathbf{GENERATE=|balance|×integration_a}$ 
### Other relationships include:
- $\mathbf{GENERATION=limitation×integration^2}$ 

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

### If the above is true, we can then state:

- The ability to **GENERATE** can be increased by decreasing **|limitation|** and increasing **|balance|**.
- To increase **|balance|** without increasing **|limitation|**, increase **|integration|~a~**.

### Some observations:
Each **[instanciation]** of energy expresses itself differently depending on its **[context]**, but we categorize them under each of the fundamental tholonic properties:



| |balance| | |limitation| | |integration| |
| ------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| FORCE   | mass       | motion      |
| 6       | 2          | 3           |
| VOLTS   | RESISTANCE | current     |



At first glance the concept of **|balance|** would not seem to apply for concepts like **<u>FORCE</u>** or **VOLTS**, as these concepts are ones of energy, change, transformation, etc., that result in states of imbalance.  While that is true, the changes or transformations that result form **<u>FORCE</u>** or **VOLTS** comes from the difference between two already **|balanced|** but different energy levels.  Earth is in a **|balanced|** state, so is a giant asteroid gently and lazily ”floating” through space at 55,000 mph.  The change and transformation happens when the high **|balanced|** energy asteroid meets the low **|balanced|** earth.

## Entanglement or Cause & Effect

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

- **momentum** is defined as **rate-of-change**

- **mass** is defined as **[instanciation]**

- **motion** is defined as **change-in-location**

- **velocity** is defined as **speed-and-direction-of-change**

- **acceleration** is defined as **|imbalance|**

  - **acceleration** creates a greater release of energy, increasing the variance of energy within the **[context]**, which results is some level of disruption, or **|imbalance|**.

- **<u>FORCE</u>** is defined as **IMPULSE**

- **body** is defined as **entangled**

- **<u>POWER</u>** is defined as **change-in-location-PER-time**

- **[context]** is defined as **entanglement**

- **[scope]** is defined as **Normalization**

───────────────────────────────────────────────

1. **IMPULSE** produces **change-in-location** in **[instance]** by creating **INCREASED-|imbalance|**. 
2. If an **[instance]** experiences no **INCREASED-|imbalance|**, then there is no **IMPULSE**.
3. An **[instance]** can exist without being being disrupted by an **IMPULSE**, but there can be no **rate-of-change** or **INCREASED-|imbalance|** of the **[instance]** without **IMPULSE**.
4. **IMPULSE** is the cause, **INCREASED-|imbalance|** is the immediate and disequilibriated effect.
5. Changes to **[instance]** (due to **IMPULSE**) alters the **[instance]**’S **rate-of-change** along the **SPEED-AND-DIRECTION-OF-DISPLACEMENT** (relative to the **[instance]**) is the lasting equilibriated effect.
6. **IMPULSE** and **INCREASED-|imbalance|** combined produce **change-in-location** over time in the direction of **SPEED-AND-DIRECTION-OF-DISPLACEMENT**.

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

### The basic relationships in **POINT-OF-EXCHANGE** are as follows:

- **IMPULSE**  =  (**[instance]** × **INCREASED-|imbalance|**)
- **[instance]**  =  (**IMPULSE** ÷ **INCREASED-|imbalance|**)
- **INCREASED-|imbalance|**  =  (**IMPULSE** ÷ **[instance]**)
- **change-in-location-PER-time**  =  (**IMPULSE** × **INCREASED-|imbalance|**)

### Other relationships include:

- **change-in-location-PER-time**  =  (**[instance]** × **change-in-location^2^**)

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

### If the above is true, we can then state:

- **change-in-location-PER-time** can be increased by ~~decreasing~~ increasing **[instance]** and/or increasing **IMPULSE**.
- **change-in-location-PER-time** can be increased by increasing **[instance]**, **change-in-location**, or **IMPULSE**.
- To increase **IMPULSE** without increasing **[instance]**, increase **INCREASED-|imbalance|**.

None of these statement appear to be false.

### Some Observations:

- This tricky aspect of cause and effect is that it typically requires a mass and a force that intersect at some point. Moving this to the conceptual realm, what do we mean by **mass**, **<u>FORCE</u>**, and **POINT-OF-EXCHANGE**? We state that **mass** is defined as a coherent structure in material form, but in the conceptual or archetypal realm, a coherent structure could be a theory, hypothesis, good idea, or memory. **<u>FORCE</u>**, or **IMPULSE** in this context, could be an act of will or an emotional, instinctual, or conditioned response. Defining the **POINT-OF-EXCHANGE** that will alter an idea's "speed and direction" is difficult to quantify as we have no idea how to measure such things.

## Light and Radiation

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

- **momentum** is defined as **DEFINED-space**
- **mass** is defined as **time**
- **motion** is defined as **space**
- **velocity** is defined as **space~v~**
- **acceleration** is defined as **space~a~**
- **<u>FORCE</u>** is defined as **c**
- **body** is defined as **photon**
- **<u>POWER</u>** is defined as **joules**
- **[context]** is defined as **energy (in spacetime)**
- **[scope]** is defined as **SI Units**

**───────────────────────────────────────────────** 

1. ***c*** produces **space** in **time** by creating **space~a~**. 
   1. ‘produce’ is not really the correct word here, but I am not sure what word is correct.  At ***c*** (the speed of light), time stops and the Universe shrinks to zero size, so while ***c*** may not be ‘producing’ space and time, space and time cease to exist at ***c***.  Perhaps the better word here is ‘allows’, or ‘define the limits of’.
2. If **time** has no interaction with **space~a~**, then there is no ***c***.
3. **time** can exist without **c**, but there can be no **DEFINED-space** or **space~a~** without ***c***.
   1. ‘without ***c***’ is also misleading.  It should be something like ‘as long as you are not traveling through space at ***c***’, but I don’t know the correct way for term that.
4. **c** is the cause, **space~a~** is the immediate and disequilibriated effect.
5. **c** and **space~a~** combined produce **joules** over time in the direction of **space~v~**.
   1. The ‘direction of space’ would mean all of space, and, in fact, all of space is filled with energy that can be measured in joules. It is also theoretically impossible for the universe to ever reach an energy level of zero at any point in its existence.
6. Changes in **time** (due to ***c***) in **space~v~** (relative to the observer) is the lasting equilibriated effect.
   1. We know that space can alter time, but how this is due to ***c*** is a mystery (to me), but here also we see how ***c*** has an effect on space, which we saw above in #1 as well.

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

### The basic relationships in Light & Radiation are as follows:

- **c**  =  (**time** × **space~a~**)
- **time**  =  (**c** ÷ **space~a~**)
- **space~a~**  =  (**c** ÷ **time**)
- **joules**  =  (**c** × **space~a~**)

### Other relationships include:

- **joules**  =  (**time** × **space^2^**)

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

### If the above is true, we can then state:

- **joules** can be increased by decreasing **time** and increasing ***c*** . 
- To increase **c** without increasing **time**, increase **space~a~**.

### Some observations:

 In theory, ***c*** can never change, so while both of these statements may be true, they are also impossible.

As long as we are delving into areas I know way too little about, let’s look at **E=m*c^2^***

## E=m*c*^2^

- **momentum** is defined as **MEASURE-OF-*c***
- **mass** is defined as **m**
- **motion** is defined as ***c***
- **velocity** is defined as ***c*~v~**
- **acceleration** is defined as ***c*~a~**
- **<u>FORCE</u>** is defined as **J**
- **body** is defined as **E=m*c*^2^**
- **<u>POWER</u>** is defined as **E**
- **[context]** is defined as **RELATIVITY (space-time)**
- **[scope]** is defined as **SI Units**

**───────────────────────────────────────────────** 

1. **J** produces ***c*** in **m** by creating **c~a~**. 
2. If a **m** has no interaction with ***c~a~***, then there are **J**.
3. **m** can exist without **J**, but there can be no **MEASURE-OF-*c*** or ***c~a~*** without **J**.
4. **J** is the cause, ***c~a~*** is the immediate and disequilibriated effect.
5. **J** and ***c~a~*** combined produce **E** over time in the direction of ***c~v~***.
6. Changes in **m** (due to **J**) in ***c~v~*** (relative to the observer) is the lasting equilibriated effect.

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

### The basic relationships in **E=mc²** are as follows:

- *J=m × c~a~*
- *m=J ÷ c~a~*
- *c~a~=J ÷ m*
- *E=J × c~a~*

### Other relationships include:

- *E=m × c²*

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

### If the above is true, we can then state:

- **E** can be increased by decreasing **m** and increasing **J**.
- To increase **J** without increasing **m**, increase ***c~a~***.  However, as it is impossible to increase ***c***, increasing **E** will always decrease **m**. JWFIX… test this

**Some observations:**  

- When we calculate the **<u>POWER</u>** using **E**, **m**, and ***c***, we get a value of **<u>FORCE</u>** that is **J** (joules), which is literally a unit created for measuring **<u>POWER</u>**.  One joule is equal to the energy used to accelerate a body with a mass of one kilogram using one newton of force over a distance of one meter. It is also equivalent to one **<u>WATT</u>**-second.

- The speed-of-light has only one **velocity** (***c~v~***), and its **motion** (***c***) is always on and always the same.  While ***c*** can't actually **ACCELERATE**, the ***c²*** in **E=m*c*^2^** suggests it can because this is how we define acceleration. For example, the **ACCELERATING** pull of gravity of 9.8 meter per second^2^, or 9.8m/s^2^.  However, if I was traveling at the speed of light (ignoring the fact that time stops and the universe become zero in size) and I turned on my laser pointer, the light would leave the laser at ***c***, which is literally ***c²***, which is impossible.  I guess that is where the "relativity" parts comes into play.  The interesting part is that ***c²*** *does* exist in our model as **acceleration** (***c~a~***), making **E=m*c*^2^** = **E=m*c*~a~**.  This shows that the model is in sync with reality.

- In the previous ‘Light’ example **J** (joules, or rather, electron-volts measured in joules) is the product of ***c*** × **space**, and here **J** = ***c*** × **mass**. This means that the relationship between **J~L~** (joules in light) and **J~E~** (joules in mass) is **J~L~ = 3J~E~**.  This can be shown by using the number values with the same pattern, where  **J~L~**=***18=2×3×3***, **J~E~** =***6=2×3***, therefor, ***18/3=6***.  I am not sure what this “means”, but it’s fascinating that the difference between massless energy (light) and mass energy (**m=E/c^2^**) just happens to be 3. 

- **J~L~** = *2x3^2^*, which is the exact same pattern as *E=mc^2^*.  This places ***c***^2^ in the same position as 3, which is the position as **space**/**motion**, again showing a another relationship between ***c*** and **space**, or at least between their abstractions. Also, the RESISTANCE position or 2,mass remained unaffected, which is compatible with the above claim (based on the formulas) that “**|limitation|/|definition|** (as in **mass**, **resistance**, **time**, etc.) can exist without energy, but there can be no **motion** of any type without energy.”

Let’s color way outside the lines by trying to apply this same model to society and intra-personal development.

## society,COMMUNITY

- **momentum** is defined as **level-of-activity**
- **mass** is defined as **property-and-infrastructure**
- **motion** is defined as **people**
- **velocity** is defined as **people~v~**
- **acceleration** is defined as **gatherings-of-people~a~**
- **<u>FORCE</u>** is defined as **HUMAN-ASPIRATIONS**
- **body** is defined as **society**
- **<u>POWER</u>** is defined as **A-THRIVING-COMMUNITY**
- **[context]** is defined as **Morphic/tholonic field?**
- **[scope]** is defined as **?TBD (economics?, health?, growth?)**

**───────────────────────────────────────────────** 

1) **HUMAN-ASPIRATIONS** produces **people** in **property-and-infrastructure** by creating **gatherings-of-people~a~**. 
2) If a **property-and-infrastructure** is never used by **gatherings-of-people~a~**, then there is no **HUMAN-ASPIRATIONS** involved.
3) **property-and-infrastructure** can exist without **HUMAN-ASPIRATIONS**, but there can be no **level-of-activity** or **gatherings-of-people~a~** without **HUMAN-ASPIRATIONS**.
4) **HUMAN-ASPIRATIONS** is the cause, **gatherings-of-people~a~** is the immediate and disequilibriated effect.
5) **HUMAN-ASPIRATIONS** and **gatherings-of-people~a~** combined produce **A-THRIVING-COMMUNITY** over time in the direction of **people~v~**.
6) Changes in **property-and-infrastructure** (due to **HUMAN-ASPIRATIONS**) in **people~v~** (relative to the observer) is the lasting equilibriated effect.

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

### The basic relationships in **society** are as follows:

- **HUMAN-ASPIRATIONS**  =  (**property-and-infrastructure** × **gatherings-of-people~a~**)
- **property-and-infrastructure**  =  (**HUMAN-ASPIRATIONS** ÷ **gatherings-of-people~a~**)
- **gatherings-of-people~a~**  =  (**HUMAN-ASPIRATIONS** ÷ **property-and-infrastructure**)
- **A-THRIVING-COMMUNITY**  =  (**HUMAN-ASPIRATIONS** × **gatherings-of-people~a~**)

### Other relationships include:

- **A-THRIVING-COMMUNITY**  =  (**property-and-infrastructure** × **people^2^**)

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

### If the above is true, we can then state:

- **A-THRIVING-COMMUNITY** can be increased by decreasing **property-and-infrastructure** and increasing **HUMAN-ASPIRATIONS**.
- To increase **HUMAN-ASPIRATIONS** without increasing **property-and-infrastructure**, increase **gatherings-of-people~a~**.

**Some observations:** We’re in the weeds of the Social “Sciences”, still, this turned out to be far more on target that I was expecting!  It’s also very political, as is states that when people are overly materialistic and/or their will and aspirations (and by implication, opportunities) are destroyed, so is the society, and we have plenty of real-time examples of this. We can also see how the more totalitarian governments discourage or outlaw **gatherings-of-people**.

No theory of reality would be complete without touching on Economics

## Economics

- **momentum** is defined as **marketcap**
- **mass** is defined as **production & overhead**
- **motion** is defined as **changes**
- **velocity** is defined as **service product**
- **acceleration** is defined as **GROWTH**
- **<u>FORCE</u>** is defined as **CONSUMER_DEMAND**
- **body** is defined as **economics**
- **<u>POWER</u>** is defined as **PROFIT_MARGIN**
- **[context]** is defined as **economics**
- **[scope]** is defined as **Budget**

**───────────────────────────────────────────────** 

1. Increased **CONSUMER_DEMAND** produces **changes** in **production & overhead** resulting in **GROWTH**. 
   1. Just as acceleration implies the possibility of negative acceleration (deceleration), implicit in the concept of GROWTH is negative growth. 
2. If a **production & overhead** is not driven by **CONSUMER_DEMAND**, then there is no **GROWTH**.
3. **production & overhead** can exist without **CONSUMER_DEMAND**, but there will be no **marketcap** or **GROWTH** without **CONSUMER_DEMAND**.
4. **CONSUMER_DEMAND** is the cause, **GROWTH** is the immediate and disequilibriated effect.
5. **CONSUMER_DEMAND** and **GROWTH** combined produce **PROFIT_MARGIN** over time in the direction of **service product**.
6. Changes (due to **CONSUMER_DEMAND**) in **service product** (relative to the market) is the lasting equilibriated effect.

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

### The basic relationships in **economics** are as follows:

- **CONSUMER_DEMAND**  =  (**production & overhead** × **GROWTH**)
- **production & overhead**  =  (**CONSUMER_DEMAND** ÷ **GROWTH**)
- **GROWTH**  =  (**CONSUMER_DEMAND** ÷ **production & overhead**)
- **PROFIT_MARGIN**  =  (**CONSUMER_DEMAND** × **GROWTH**)

### Other relationships include:

- **PROFIT_MARGIN**  =  (**production & overhead** × **changes**²**)

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

### If the above is true, we can then state:

- **PROFIT_MARGIN** can be increased by decreasing **production & overhead** and increasing **CONSUMER_DEMAND**.
- To increase **CONSUMER_DEMAND** without increasing **production & overhead**, increase **GROWTH**.

**Some observations:** I think every one of these statements is true, especially the last two statements.  People who have built successful businesses might disagree, but even if these statements are not 100% true, they are not false.

Now we can apply the technique to Tholonic version (v1) of this model which is based on the existing properties of holons and partons as described in the holarchic model.  The three fundamental propertied in the version 1 are of |negotiation|, |definition|, and |contribution|.  A slightly adapted version 2 uses similar concepts but with the different words of |balance|, |limitation|, and |integration|.

## Tholonic V1

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

- **momentum** is defined as amount of **|contribution|**
- **mass** is defined as **|definition|**
- **motion** is defined as **|contribution|**
- **velocity** is defined as **|contribution|~v~**
- **acceleration** is defined as **|contribution|~a~**
- **<u>FORCE</u>** is defined as **|negotiation|**
- **body** is defined as **THOLON**
- **<u>POWER</u>** is defined as **GENERATE**
- **[context]** is defined as **THOLOGRAM**
- **[scope]** is defined as **THOLONICS (TBD)**

**───────────────────────────────────────────────** 

1. **|negotiation|** produces **|contribution|** in the process of creating **|definition|** by creating **|contribution|~a~**. 
2. If a **|definition|** has no **|contribution|~a~**, then there is no **|negotiation|** involved.
3. **|definition|** can exist without **|negotiation|**, but there can be no amount of **|contribution|** or **|contribution|~a~** without **|negotiation|**.
4. **|negotiation|** is the cause, **|contribution|~a~** is the immediate and disequilibriated effect.
5. **|negotiation|** and **|contribution|~a~** combined produce the ability to **GENERATE** over time in the direction of **|contribution|~v~**.
6. Changes in **|definition|** (due to **|negotiation|**) and resulting changes in **|contribution|~v~** (relative to the parent) is the lasting equilibriated effect.

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

### The basic relationships in **THOLON** are as follows:

- **|negotiation|**  =  (**|definition|** × **|contribution|~a~**)
- **|definition|**  =  (**|negotiation|** ÷ **|contribution|~a~**)
- **|contribution|~a~**  =  (**|negotiation|** ÷ **|definition|**)
- **GENERATE**  =  (**|negotiation|** × **|contribution|~a~**)

### Other relationships include:

- **GENERATE**  =  (**|definition|** × **|contribution|^2^**)

  

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

### If the above is true, we can then state:

- The ability to **GENERATE** can be increased by decreasing **|definition|** and increasing **|negotiation|**.
- To increase **|negotiation|** without increasing **|definition|**, increase **|contribution|~a~**.

Finally, there is one more application of this pattern that is perhaps the most important, and that is in the [context] of intelligence.

## Existance

The Tholonic claim is that intelligence is a product of interaction between [instances].  The argument behinf that claim is too long to get into here, but the pattern certainyl supports that claim



**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

- **momentum** is defined as **interaction-potential**
  - Just as **momentum** is the effect of **<u>FORCE</u>** on **mass**, **intelligence** is the effect of **interaction** on **[instances]**.  Remember, **<u>FORCE</u>** is classically defined as a form on **interaction**.  **momentum** is a measure, and we currently have no way to measure **intelligence** as we define it. However, given that **intelligence** is a product of **interaction**, we can say that the higher the **interactIVITY**, the higher the **intelligence**, so we’ll call this an **interaction**-**POTENTIAL**.
- **mass** is defined as **[instance]**
  - Technically, this should the **[scope]-OF-[instance]-VIA-WHICH-intelligence-interactS**, but it just too long.  The idea is, for interaction to exist, there must be something capable of interaction that exists in a [context]. In the non-physical realm, this could be an archetype.  We see this type of  interaction of intelligenceS in origin myths and legends, or any anthropomorphism.  It could also be ideas and ‘isms’, such as the model of materialism vs. idealism vs. social constructivism vs. pragmatism vs.  interactionism, etc.
- **motion** is defined as **intelligence**
- **velocity** is defined as **APPLIED-intelligence~v~**
  - velocity implies direction, and the direction of an intelligence depends wholly on what it is capable of, what type of **interaction** or **<u>FORCE</u>** it is designed for.  The **APPLIED**-**intelligence** of a plant is optimized for converting and storing electromagnetic radiation into matter, while the **APPLIED-intelligence** of a virus is optimized for DNA/RNA replication.
- **acceleration** is defined as **novelty~a~**
  - **novelty** here refers to the physics concept of **novelty**, which means “A change to a system”.  Any change to a system alters its ability to **interact**.  Like with the concept of **acceleration**, the resulting change could be a decrease in **interaction**, but in this example we only consider **novelty** that increases  **interaction**.
- **<u>FORCE</u>** is defined as **interaction**
- **body** is defined as **existence**
- **<u>POWER</u>** is defined as **KNOWLEDGE**
  - This sounds quite cliche, as in “Knowledge is power”, but as **<u>POWER</u>** is the **interaction** between **[instances]** of **mass**, so too is **KNOWLEDGE** the **interaction** between **[instances]** of **intelligence**.

**───────────────────────────────────────────────** 

1. **interaction** produces **intelligence** in **[instanciation]** by creating **novelty~a~**. 
2. If a **[instanciation]** has no interaction with **novelty~a~**, then there is no **interaction** involved.
3. **[instanciation]** can exist without **interaction**, but there can be no **intelligence** or **novelty~a~** without **interaction**.
4. **interaction** is the cause, **novelty~a~** is the immediate and disequilibriated effect.
5. **interaction** and **noveltya** combined produce **KNOWLEDGE** over time in the direction of **APPLIED-intelligence~v~**.
6. Changes (due to **interaction**) in **APPLIED-intelligence~v~** (relative to the observer) is the lasting equilibriated effect.

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

### The basic relationships in **Existance** are as follows:

- **[instance]**  =  (**interaction** ÷ **novelty~a~^2^**)

### Other relationships include:

- **KNOWLEDGE**  =  (**[instance]** × **intelligence^2^**
- **KNOWLEDGE**  =  (**[instance]** × **APPLIED-intelligence~v~^2^**

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

### If the above is true, we can then state:

- **KNOWLEDGE** can be increased by increasing **[instance]**, **intelligence**, or **interaction**.
- To increase **interaction** without increasing **[instance]**, increase **novelty~a~**.

To end this, let’s look at the ultimate abstraction of existence.  But first, we need to look at one more Tholonic concepts.



**A&I**:  This represent **AWARENESS** & INT**E**NTION, which are the two inseparable properties from which all existence emerges.  **AWARENESS** is considered the **[context]**-free and unlimited archetype of consciousness, which itself is considered a limited **[contextual]** **[instance]** of **AWARENESS**.  **INTENTION** is the willful movement of **AWARENESS**, for lack of a better description.  There is no **INTENTION** without **AWARENESS**, and vice-versa, in some way similar to the fact that there no space-time without both space and time, or no electrical charge with a magnetic field.

Conceptually, pure **A&I** can be imagined as a 0 dimensional point.  Having no dimensions, it does not exist other that a concept.  It exists solely due to your **AWARENESS** of its existence.  However, it can only exist in your **AWARENESS** is you have the **INTENTION** to be aware if it.  As this point was created by the properties of **AWARENESS** and **INTENTION**, it also has the (latent) properties of **AWARENESS** and **INTENTION**.  In a reality that consists of only a 0 dimensional point, there can be no time or space, which means pure **A&I** is unconstrained by time or space, making this 0 dimensional point effectively infinite.

Before we go on, I want to stress that is not not meant to sound religious or spiritual.  This is a purely analytical approach to look as the concepts of **AWARENESS** and **INTENTION**, which are becoming more front and center in the world of physics and technology every day, to the point where physicists beginning to consider consciousness as one of the fundamental forces of the Universe, and with the explosion of AI (artificial intelligence) and AGI (artificial general intelligence, e.g., when AI can teach itself and has “understanding”), where some engineers have already claim AI and achieved self-awareness and consciousness, these can no longer be considered purly philosophical, spiritual or religions concept.

## Awareness

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

- **momentum** is defined as **MEASURE**
  - This is because **momentum** *is* a measure.

- **mass** is defined as **DUALITY**
  - Just as **mass** is **[contextual]** **[instance]**, so is **DUALITY** a **[contextual]** **[instance]**, but the **[context]** is entirely of creation.  Not coincidently, the numerical value of **DUALITY** turns out yo be 2.

- **motion** is defined as **MOVEMENT**
- **velocity** is defined as **INTENTION**
  - **velocity** always has a direction, as does **INTENTION**

- **acceleration** is defined as **CREATION**
  - The act of **CREATION** requires **MOVEMENT**, and **MOVEMENT** require **acceleration**.  Similar to how **DUALITY** has the numerical value of 2, **CREATION** has the numerical value of 3.

- **<u>FORCE</u>** is defined as **A&I**
- **body** is defined as **[instance]**
  - In this case **[instance]** means anything that exists, in any form, in any dimension, as longs as it has limits.

- **<u>POWER</u>** is defined as **CONSCIOUSNESS**
  - **<u>POWER</u>** is the the measure of **<u>FORCE</u>** over time. Using this same reasoning, **CONSCIOUSNESS** is the timeless and infinite **AWARENESS** and **INTENTION** expressed over time.

- **[context]** is defined as **All that exists**

**───────────────────────────────────────────────** 

1) **A&I** produces **MOVEMENT** in **DUALITY** by **CREATION**.  
4) If a **DUALITY** is void of **CREATION**, then it is void of **A&I**.
4) **DUALITY** can exist without **A&I**, but will remain a void lacking any **MEASURE** or **CREATION** without **A&I**. 
4) **A&I** is the cause, **CREATION** is the immediate and disequilibriated effect.
5) **A&I** and **CREATION** combined produce **CONSCIOUSNESS** over time in the direction of **INTENTION**.
6) Changes (due to **A&I**) in **INTENTION** (relative to the observer) is the lasting equilibriated effect.

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

### The basic relationships in [instance] are as follows:
- **A&I**  =  (**DUALITY** × **CREATION**)
- **DUALITY~2~**  =  (**A&I** ÷ **CREATION**)
- **CREATION**  =  (**A&I ÷ DUALITY**)
- **CONSCIOUSNESS**  =  (**A&I** × **CREATION**)
### Other relationships include:
- **CONSCIOUSNESS**  =  (**DUALITY** × **MOVEMENT^2^**)

**───────────────────────────────────────────────**

### If the above is true, we can then state:
- **CONSCIOUSNESS~18~** can be increased by increasing **DUALITY~2~**, **MOVEMENT~3-motion~**, or **A&I~6~**.
- To increase **A&I~6~** without increasing **DUALITY~2~**, increase **CREATION~3-acceleration~**.

- 

- **Some Observations so far**

  - the **|balance|** **[instances]** (**<u>6</u>**, **<u>FORCE</u>**,**VOLTS**) and the **GENERATE** **[instances]** (**<u>18</u>**, **<u>POWER</u>**, **<u>WATTS</u>**) are the only values that are arrived at by multiplication. All other values are the products of division.

  - The **|limitation|** **[instances]** (**2, mass, RESISTANCE**) are quite celary forms of |limit|AITON. This is explicitly poimnted out in teh physics definition of **mass** and **resistance**.  As for 2, it is 2 that turns the unity of **1** into a duality (that’s why it is called a duality, from Latin “duo”, meaning "2"), make 2 the  **|limitation|** of 1.

  - ~~, that is 2 that turns the unity of **1** into a duality, making oit very clear that is is 2 that divided the suggesting that duality, the division and separation of what was whole and complete, is a form of, or result of,  **resistance** (as if we are not reminded of that daily).  This makes 2 the number of **DIVISION** and **resistance**e division and separation of what was whole and complete, is a form of, or result of,  **resistance** (as if we are not reminded of that daily).  This makes 2 the number of **DIVISION** and **resistance**~~

  - ~~This is intuitively and rationally obvious, but a form of **resistance** (as it is energy (**E**) divided by ***c^2^***, according to ***m=E÷c^2^***. Division is, by definition, the division and separation of what was whole and complete, and is represented as 2. In the case of **mass**, the whole that is being divided by **acceleration** is **<u>FORCE</u>**. However, as FORCE = mass × acceleration, and acceleration = mass ÷ meters per second per second, we can say FORCE=mass÷(m/s^2^), or FORCE=mass×(space/time).  This suggets that time, beign th eonly dividing factor, is also equivalen to 2 in the math [context] and  RESISTANCE in the electricity [context].  Further on, we’ll see how time  and n instance or is a form ois resistanmce, and .  This~~ 

    ~~Space ÷ time is the domain of frequency. Time ÷ space is the domain of wavelength.   mass ÷ m/s^2^ is therefore mass ÷ frequencyeters per second per secondFor example, 2 hours/50 miles = 0.04 hours/mile, or 2.4 minutes per mile, e.g., time measured by space.~~

  - ~~IN the case of .  Although this is a metaphysical observation, it is 2 that turns the unity of **1** into a duality, suggesting that duality, the division and separation of what was whole and complete, is a form of, or result of,  **resistance** (as if we are not reminded of that daily).  This makes 2 the number of **DIVISION** and **resistance**, and in the Tholonic model, 2 is the number of **|definition|** and **|limitation|**~~

  - On an even more philosophical note, **<u>FORCE</u>**, being **<u>6</u>**, is a value that can not exist without 2 or 3.  This suggests that Force, which is the ‘cause’ of **[instance]** and **motion** is itself the ‘effect’ of **[instance]** and **motion**, which are themselves the effect of **<u>FORCE</u>**.  It’s circular logic.

  - **motion** (**acceleration**, **velocity**), on the other hand, is the result of balancing the division or difference in a duality, because energy only moves when there is an imbalance.  This balancing of the division created by 2 is represented as 3.  Given that energy always seeks the most stable (i.e., the path of least resistance, or the state that expends the least energy), this makes 3 the number of **|balance|** and **SUSTAINABILITY**.  In the Tholonic model, 3 is the number of **|integration|** and **|contribution|**.

  - **<u>FORCE</u>** results from 3 balancing the 2 that imbalanced the **1** (so, really, the pattern is 6 = 1×2×3).  In which case, **<u>FORCE</u>** is the **EFFECT**, not the **CAUSE**, but given that *6 = 2×3*, it is also the **CAUSE** of further division and balancing.  For this reason, **<u>6</u>** can be a **CAUSE** or an **EFFECT**, depending on **[context]**.  In the Tholonic model, **<u>6</u>** as a ‘parent’ represents the source of **resistance** and **motion**, and as a ‘child’, the **|negotiated|** sustainable state that emerges from that same **resistance** and **|balance|**.  The complete tholon, therefore, is composed of a parent **<u>6</u>**, a child and the two factors of 2 and 3, which, when all combined, is *216=6^3^*.
