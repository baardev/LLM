1) Newtons 2nd Law describes how FORCE can alter the MOTION of BODY.
2) It states that the MOMENTUM is the result of, and proportional, to the FORCE imposed on BODY.
3) The MOMENTUM is equal to (MASS x VELOCITY), therefore, (FORCE = MASS x ACCELERATION).
4) The presence of FORCE on BODY creates ACCELERATION (in accordance with the equation).
5) Conversely, if a BODY has no ACCELERATION, that means there is no FORCE.
6) Therefore, MASS alone can exist without FORCE or ACCELERATION, but there can be no MOMENTUM or any ACCELERATION without FORCE.
